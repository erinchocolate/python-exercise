If you are like most people, you don’t often think about lobsters unless you’re eating one 
However, these interesting and delicious crustaceans are very much worth considering
Their nervous systems are comparatively simple, with large, easily observable neurons, the magic cells of the brain 
Because of this, scientists have been able to map the neural circuitry of lobsters very accurately
This has helped us understand the structure and function of the brain and behaviour of more complex animals
Lobsters have more in common with you than you might think particularly when you are feeling crabby
